This is my PA05. 
***Required Features***
-Loads all models in all the supported formats of Blender. 
-Does not support files with multiple objects
***********************

***Other Features***
-Based on how Assimp loads model file colors will be different.
-Used Assimp tutorial.  
********************

***Notes***
-Uses Assimp 3.0.
-Works on Ubuntu 13.04.
-Will only load model vertices therefore it has same functionality as PA05
***********

***Bugs***
-Running this program without a command argument for the object file will seg fault program. Not really a bug but the program is not robust.
