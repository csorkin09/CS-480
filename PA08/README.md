- Albert Wohletz
- Brian Catudan
- Collin Sorkin(submitted under Collin's account)


***Required Features***
- Loads multiple objects with texture images.
- Demonstrates the use of the bullet physics engine.
***********************

***Other Features***
- Uses Assimp 3 to load models.
- Uses ImageMagick++ to load textures.
- Uses bullet 2.81 for object physics.
********************

***Notes***
The program for how takes no command line arguments and all required obj files will be included in the submission.

When the program starts a sphere will fall from the top of the screen and collide with the cylinder moving both objects. Upon landing on the  board the sphere can be controlled by the arrow keys to move and collide with other objects.

The board and box are static objects while the sphere and cylinder are dynamic objects.
